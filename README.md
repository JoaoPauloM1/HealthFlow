<h2>📌 About</h2>
<p>This project is a website focused on online health calculations, developed as part of my studies in Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. The goal was to practice and improve my knowledge of these technologies by creating a functional and interactive platform in the browser.</p>
<p>The website allows users to explore features for general well-being in a dynamic and interactive way.</p>
